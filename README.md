STARY CONDOHOTEL is a fully operational web application designed for accommodation services. The platform offers users access to a range of available room types, along with features to create personal accounts, manage profiles, make accommodation bookings, and leave reviews.

In addition to user-focused features, the site provides administrative tools that allow staff to manage bookings and reviews, and make changes on behalf of guests—ensuring a smooth and personalized accommodation booking experience.

## UX

The design philosophy focuses on creating a simple, colorful, and stylish look. The website features a smooth, intuitive flow, making it easy to navigate so users never feel lost or stuck.

### Colour Scheme and Fonts


The website features a primary color scheme of orange and graphite, creating an elegant and visually engaging browsing experience.

For typography, the title font is Ancízar Serif—a naturally diverse typeface designed for everyday use in a wide range of contexts. Its consistent structure enhances both readability and visual identity. For body text, Noto Serif is used, chosen for its versatility as part of a global font collection that supports writing in all modern and ancient languages.

## Testing

For all testing, please refer to the [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) 

## Deployment

The live deployed application can be found deployed on [Heroku](https://condohotel-02aa4cf88da7.herokuapp.com/).

### Heroku Deployment

This project uses [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com), a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.

Deployment steps are as follows, after account setup:

- Select **New** in the top-right corner of your Heroku Dashboard, and select **Create new app** from the dropdown menu.
- Your app name must be unique, and then choose a region closest to you (EU or USA), and finally, select **Create App**.
- From the new app **Settings**, click **Reveal Config Vars**, and set your environment variables.

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `CLOUDINARY_URL` | user's own value |
| `DATABASE_URL` | user's own value |
| `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC` | 1 (*this is temporary, and can be removed for the final deployment*) |
| `SECRET_KEY` | user's own value |

Heroku needs two additional files in order to deploy properly.
- requirements.txt
- Procfile

You can install this project's **requirements** (where applicable) using:
- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

If you have your own packages that have been installed, then the requirements file needs updated using:
- `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`

The **Procfile** can be created with the following command:
- `echo web: gunicorn app_name.wsgi > Procfile`
- *replace **app_name** with the name of your primary Django app name; the folder where settings.py is located*

For Heroku deployment, follow these steps to connect your own GitHub repository to the newly created app:

Either:
- Select **Automatic Deployment** from the Heroku app.

Or:
- In the Terminal/CLI, connect to Heroku using this command: `heroku login -i`
- Set the remote for Heroku: `heroku git:remote -a app_name` (replace *app_name* with your app name)
- After performing the standard Git `add`, `commit`, and `push` to GitHub, you can now type:
	- `git push heroku main`

The project should now be connected and deployed to Heroku!

### Local Deployment

This project can be cloned or forked in order to make a local copy on your own system.

For either method, you will need to install any applicable packages found within the *requirements.txt* file.
- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

You will need to create a new file called `env.py` at the root-level,
and include the same environment variables listed above from the Heroku deployment steps.

Sample `env.py` file:

```python
import os

os.environ.setdefault("CLOUDINARY_URL", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("DATABASE_URL", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "user's own value")

# local environment only (do not include these in production/deployment!)
os.environ.setdefault("DEBUG", "True")
```

Once the project is cloned or forked, in order to run it locally, you'll need to follow these steps:
- Start the Django app: `python3 manage.py runserver`
- Stop the app once it's loaded: `CTRL+C` or `⌘+C` (Mac)
- Make any necessary migrations: `python3 manage.py makemigrations`
- Migrate the data to the database: `python3 manage.py migrate`
- Create a superuser: `python3 manage.py createsuperuser`
- Load fixtures (if applicable): `python3 manage.py loaddata file-name.json` (repeat for each file)
- Everything should be ready now, so run the Django app again: `python3 manage.py runserver`

#### Cloning

You can clone the repository by following these steps:

1. Go to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/adamshaw90/Trip-easy)
2. Locate the Code button above the list of files and click it 
3. Select if you prefer to clone using HTTPS, SSH, or GitHub CLI and click the copy button to copy the URL to your clipboard
4. Open Git Bash or Terminal
5. Change the current working directory to the one where you want the cloned directory
6. In your IDE Terminal, type the following command to clone my repository:
	- `git clone https://github.com/adamshaw90/Trip-easy.git`
7. Press Enter to create your local clone.

Alternatively, if using Gitpod, you can click below to create your own workspace using this repository.

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/adamshaw90/Trip-easy)

Please note that in order to directly open the project in Gitpod, you need to have the browser extension installed.
A tutorial on how to do that can be found [here](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/user-settings/browser-extension).

#### Forking

By forking the GitHub Repository, we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original owner's repository.
You can fork this repository by using the following steps:

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/adamshaw90/Trip-easy)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. Once clicked, you should now have a copy of the original repository in your own GitHub account!

### Local VS Deployment

The local version, created on Gitpod, does not have the functionality to send confirmation emails. This is due to the fact that Gitpod blocks the necessary email port required to carry out this operation. Gitpod blocks this port by default due to concerns about email spam and it cannot be changed.
