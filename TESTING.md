## WAVE EVALUATION

I tested my deployed project using the WAVE evaluation tool to assess accessibility.

All pages flagged a contrast issue related to the orange button with white text. While this does not meet standard contrast requirements, the button contains large text and is prominently sized. As it aligns with our established design patterns, we have decided to retain this styling.
